Continue to build on the patterns you crafted in the previous week. Form “organisms” from your molecules and a template from your organisms. Remember, you are building actual html/css patterns that will be used in your site - this is not a static mockup. 

Organisms you need to include: header, images with captions, footer, main content section and your external link. You should have a complete template of your site by the end of the week.

At this point, the main HTML page should contain base styling, a header, a footer, a main content section, embedded images, and navigation. 


GitHub

 Create a new GitHub repository:

Sign in to your GitHub account
Select the plus (+) sign and choose “New repository”
Name the new repository – bioSite
Choose “Public” and “Initialize this repository with a README”
Covert the bioSite repository to a GitHub page:

Select “Settings” from the toolbar
Select “Options” and scroll until you see “GitHub Pages”
Under “Source” expand the drop-down-menu and select “master branch”
Save
Upload your bioSite:

Navigate to your bioSite repository (github.com/yourAccountName/bioSite
Select “Upload Files” and either “choose your files” or drag the files to add
Under “Commit changes” – Enter a brief description
Make sure “Commit directly to the master branch” is selected
Commit changes  
Visit https://yourAccountName.github.io/bioSite/ and verify the site is running
Notes:

The repository created in week three’s (3) assignment – Activity 3.3 – GitHub Repositories should only contain a README.md file.  We will be adding to this repository in later sessions.
We will be using GitHub pages to host and publish WEB 200’s bioSite application.
The bioSite application must be viewable, as an HTML website, using the above link.
The bioSite applications main HTML page must be named "index.html." 
We will not be using the Command Line Interface (CLI) for staging, committing, or pushing changes to the bioSite repository.  WEB 230 will be our first introduction to the CLI and afterwards the expectation is to only use the CLI for staging, committing, and pushing changes to a repository.
