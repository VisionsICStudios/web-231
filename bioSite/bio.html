            Dominic William Wilson was born on Teusday November 28th 2012 at 3:34 AM. His birth weight was
            9 lbs, 9oz. At the time of birth, Dominic came out of the birth canal with the ambilical cord
            wrapped around his neck. The doctor worked quickly to remove it and perform childhood CPR.
            Dominic began to breath on his own and so forth his life began just as any normal infant's life 
            would.
            </p><br>

            <p class="paragraphs">
            Dominic began to walk at age 2. From there, he was off and running. Dominic has always been a very
            active child even in his toddler stage. It was at age 2 when we noticed his development progression
            was delayed. Especially in the area of his speech and phonetic abilities. Dominic also experienced
            minor delays in his ability to hold a fork, and a spoon. This is when my wife and I proceeded to put
            him into an Early Childhood Intervention program.
            </p><br>

            <p class="paragraphs">
            During Dominic's time at DCIU (Delaware County Intermediate Unit), he made pretty good progress
            towards eliminating some of his delays or delayed behavior. It was at DCIU where they made the
            discovery and diagnosed him as a child with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). Dominic displays certain
            behavioral patterns that typical children with ASD have, like speech looping, referring to himself in
            3rd person, and restless shaking of the head. Staff at DCIU worked with him to minimize these habits.
            </p><br>

            <p class="paragraphs">
            Now at age 5, Dominic is currently attending Kindergarten. He has made great strides to overcome certain
            obsticles with his speech. An Occupational therapist is also working with him to focus on development of
            his fine motor skill. Dominic also had a heavy gate (walk) pattern. The state of Pennsylvania would not
            authorize physical therapy for him. I corrected his gate myself by walking him home from school. Dominic
            remains to be a hard worker with a very happy and positive attitude to which makes me proud to be his dad!
